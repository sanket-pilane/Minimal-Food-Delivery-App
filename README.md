# Minimal Food 

A food delivery app made with Flutter x Firebase pre-built, functional and ready to go out of the box. This app has email authentication and backend already built in. The user can create an account, browse the menu, add to cart, and input card payment details. The order will then be placed and saved into Firebase for real-time live updates. The app will generate a receipt for the user as a summary of the order.
